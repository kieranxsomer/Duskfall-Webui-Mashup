# Duskfall-Webui-Mashup
Attempting to mash together a notebook or fail trying LOL.

So far i'm not anywhere near ready to publish this, and nor am i giving up OVERALL.. just..
Need to wait for more brain power!

I'm aiming at the following:

Making it a local install like LastBen.
Adding Ngrok as well as LocalTunnel 

Adding the Emjoy finder (that exists and works it just, the rest of it doesnt lol) 

Making it SIMPLE ENOUGH but advanced enoguh that if you're beyond the tiny simple things to dive in to this one. 

POSSIBLY making it a combined training notebook, looking at who I can work with to make that work to include KohyaSS stuff as well as native models in different options.. 

I dunno I REALLY JUST wanted to sort of make my mark somehow besides making AI models :).
